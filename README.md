# In this repository, I keep my codes in U(N)-susy-snr-V3 which produced Fig.8 & Fig.9 of my paper--"Towards TeV-Scale Supersymmetric Electroweak Baryogenesis", check the link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09147.pdf
# Also, I stored a few of modified py file(generic_potential.py, helper_functions.py, transitionFinder.py) from CosmoTransition Package for reference. CosmoTransition Package: https://github.com/clwainwright/CosmoTransitions
